  title: 'What to pack for the Kilimanjaro Climb',
  content: "Welcome to Lauwo Adventure’s Kilimanjaro trekking packing list. We have carefully selected the items to ensure maximum comfort and safety while hiking the mountain. Please contact us or a reputable mountaineering equipment dealer if you have any questions about the items on the list or the suitability of your own equipment.
  HEAD AND FACE:
  Pile or Wool hat: Bring one that covers ears, a balaclava type is excellent.
  Shade Hat: Visor hats with good brims are essential for protection from the equatorial sun.
  Sunglasses: Essential for eye protection in the tropics, at altitude. Bring a good quality pair, preferably with an IREX protection rating of 100. Attachable side shields are necessary, or bring glacier glasses.
  Sunscreen: Bring plenty of complete sunblock with a protection factor of 15 or more. Unless you have spent time in equatorial sun, you will probably underestimate the amount necessary, so bring lots.
  Lip Balm: With an SPF rating of 15 or more.
  Bandanas: Tied around the neck, they give good sun protection, act as leaning glasses, as washcloths, etc. They dry very quickly.
  UPPER BODY LAYERS:
  Three warm layers for the upper body: made of wool, synthetic, or pile. A good combination is a long underwear top, a sweater, and a pile jacket or heavy wool shirt. Make sure all layers fit comfortably over each other and supply good insulation. Cotton items do not provide adequate insulation and are completely useless when damp.
  T-Shirts: Two T-shirts that you don't mind getting dirty while on the mountain. Synthetic is best.
  Rain Parka: Afternoon showers are common in East Africa, especially on the mountain. Bring a good parka of Gortex or waterproof nylon that has been “seam-sealed”.
  Wind Shirt: (optional if you have Gortex rain gear) A nylon wind shell (not waterproof), roomy enough to fit comfortably over all upper body layers. Gortex is good for both this wind shirt and for the raincoat.
  Poncho: (Optional) Quick and handy protection for the body and rucksack. Poor protection in windy rain.
  Gloves or Mittens: Wool or pile. One pair of heavy mittens and a light pair of gloves work well.
  Mitten Shells: One pair to go over your mittens. These are for use against the winds sometimes encountered in the crater and on the way to the summit.
  LOWER BODY LAYERS:
  Quick Dry Hiking Shorts: 1 pair. Good for hiking at lower elevations on the mountain.
  Long Underwear Bottoms: One pair. Wool or synthetic.
  Wool, Bunting or Pile Pants: One pair that fits loosely and is comfortable. These are essential to be worn over the long john bottoms.
  Rain Pants: Bring a good pair of rain pants of Gortex or waterproof nylon that has been “seam-sealed”.
  Wind Pants: (optional if you have Gortex rain pants.) One pair. These are used often on the mountain for protection against wind. They should be breathable nylon and roomy enough to fit comfortably over wool or pile pants.
  Tights: Lycra or polypropylene type are comfortable to hike in, provide good warmth on cool misty days, dry fast, and prevent sunburn.
  Undergarments: Enough for the duration of the trek.
  FOR THE FEET:
  Thin Socks: Two pairs of synthetic socks to wear under heavy wool socks. These help to prevent blisters and keep feet dry.
  Thick Socks: Six pairs of heavy wool
  Extra pair of normal socks which can be used during and after hiking "

  Experience the thrill of Kilimanjaro trekking with an experienced Mount Kilimanjaro climbing tour company such as Lauwo Adventures. We understand and consider your safety and well-being as of utmost importance when embarking on this journey. Here are some tips to help you prepare for your Kilimanjaro trek:
  Vaccinations:
  To ensure a safe and healthy journey, it's recommended to get vaccinated before your Kilimanjaro trek. Some important vaccinations to consider include:
  • Malaria: Tanzania is endemic for malaria, and travelers are at risk in most parts of the country. To prevent malaria, it's recommended to use treated mosquito nets, wear long pants and closed footwear, and use effective repellent.
  • Yellow Fever: Travelers entering Tanzania from areas with risk of yellow fever transmission are required to provide a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
  • Other vaccinations to consider include Cholera, Diphtheria, Hepatitis A & B, Meningococcal Meningitis (ACWY), Polio, Tuberculosis (TB), Typhoid Fever, and Rabies. It's best to consult with your GP or travel health clinic to discuss the necessary vaccinations for your trip.
  Medications:
  Altitude sickness can be a concern when trekking Kilimanjaro. Here are some medications you should consider taking with you:
  • Analgesics: Ibuprofen/Nurofen can help relieve altitude-induced headaches.
  • Anti-Allergy: Hydrocortisone creams and oral antihistamines can help with insect bites and stings, as well as allergies.
  • Anti-Diarrhea: Loperamide hydrochloride (Immodium) and diarrheal sachets can help with the treatment of diarrhea.
  • Altitude sickness medicine (Diamox): Acetazolamide (Diamox) is used for the treatment and prevention of altitude sickness. It's recommended to take a trial course prior to going to Kilimanjaro.
  • Sterile eye drops: These may be useful if you get dust or grit in your eyes.
  • Anti-malarial prophylaxis medicine: Consult with your GP or travel clinic about malaria prophylaxis.
  • Mosquito sprays and creams: These will not be required on Kilimanjaro due to the altitude, but will be required before and after your ascent. Products containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) are recommended as the most effective form of bite-preventive treatment.
  • Sun cream: Don't forget to pack sun cream to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays.
  It's important to consult with your GP or travel health clinic about any vaccinations or medications you may need before embarking on your Kilimanjaro trek. Taking the necessary precautions can help ensure a safe and healthy journey."
